# ðŸ¤¯ REFLECT
# Tried too hard to do it well the first time. Trying a second time to just get it to work!

# ðŸ¤¯ REFLECT 2.0
# prod() is an amazing thing to have. This seems a little more complicated without it. Nothing else I was trying worked!
# for loop has i, item and is enumerated, but item is not used. Look for a way to do it without enumerating?
